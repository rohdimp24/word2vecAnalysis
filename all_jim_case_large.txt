After first startup since turnaround on 11/1/2014, thrust position has changed from ~-0.100 mm to ~0.150 mm. Thrust temperature difference has also changed from ~-7.00 deg C to ~3.00 deg C. Is this new running condition acceptable to train in to the model

HRSG gas differential pressurehas been slowly rising starting 11/7/2014. The diff pressures have normally run 11.5-12.5 psig and are now running up to 13.5 psig. This looks to be due to the higher inlet pressures. Also, the units for the HRSG inlet pressure are inH2O and the HRSG outlet pressure and diff pressure are in psig. Should this all be in in H2O or psig 

Since the most recent startup on 11/1/2014, DE and NDE seal supply pressure has been high, ranging from ~62.0 barg and ~70.0 bar. Both seal supply pressures flat lined at 70.0 barg from 11/20/2014 to 11/21/2014.

On 12/1/2014, pump thrust positions began to vary from ~-0.10 mm to ~0.15 mm. This variable thrust position coincides with an increase in suction pressure from ~16.0 barg to ~30.0 barg. 12/15/2014 - Issue persisted until shutdown on 12/11/2014.

The exhaust vacuum feedback increased up to 6 in H20, up to 1.5 in H20 above thee model estimates on 7/7/2015.   Update 8/28/2015: Data has come back in line with the model.  Update 9/12/2015: The exhaust vacuum feedback has increased up to as high as 5.75 in H20 on 9/9. 

We have seen the vibrations and temperatures increasing recently. The highest vibration seems to correlate with a loss in lube oil pressure that did not alert on SmartSignal. The lube oil temperature seems to be also increasing slightly to ~53degC. Can we train this in since it does not look like we have reached the limits of 60um yet 

May 23: We changed the alarms for the lube oil pressure to a LO1.6 and a HI1.85bar so that it will alarm the next time this issue reoccurs.

12/2/14: Lube oil tank levels are currently ~14.5 in. GE IPRC will close the actioned case item.
Update (10/1/14): Condition persists
Starting 8/28/14, lube oil tank level suddenly drops ~0.8 in. without any noticeable change in bearing oil drain temperatures.

Over the last 2 weeks we note that the Suction Temperature has reached 49DegC, and the DE/NDE Seal temperatures have increased with the highest being 93DegC (Case 2 DE Seal Temperature) We have Suction temperature limits of 45DegC and Seal Temperature limits at 95DegC. 15 June 2016: Condition looks to be recovering for the Case 1 and 2 DE/NDE Seal Temperatures as well as the suction temperature

The steam turbine is experiencing spikes in vibration that have been occurring since the end of August.  Bearing 1, 2, 3, and 4 are all experiencing large spikes of short duration, with the most recent exceeding 5 mils.  Bearing 1 X and Y indications are moving in an opposite direction, and all the other vibration indications are all showing positive spikes.

Whenever there is a shift in gross load (70MW to baseline), Y axial shaft position (MAD20CY012) generally spikes higher and as the cycle progresses, vibrations starts decreasing. After 9/28 shift in the gross load, Y axial shaft position bearing vibrations remains elevated from ~6.25mils to ~6.75 mils and have not decreased.

Update 7/7/2015: Noted conditions have persisted. 

Update 10/20/2015:  The thrust position has been in the same range over the last few months. 

1/26/2016: This is an outage, GE is updating for site.

6/21: Y axial shaft position (MAD20CY012)  has been reporting values of 2.13 mils after the outage. 

Looking at the model tags we have, at times our parent tag shows the compressor running when other indications like lube oil indicate the machine is down. Is it possible to get motor amps, speed to add to the model. This is a problem on both A and B machines

12/16/14: Y axial shaft position returned to the estimates. Was there any action taken
Post outage step chan observed on Y Axial Shaft Position (MAD20CY012) from ~5.7 to ~8 mils. Prior to the outage differential between the Y axial shaft positions was ~1 mils and it currently is ~2 mils.

Starting 1/5, step change was observed in Y Axial Shaft Pos (MAD20CY011 and MAD20CY012) decreased from ~4.5 to ~2.7 mils with no change in lube oil outlet temperature and thrust bearing metal temperatures.

Adapt model Tag alias Discharge Flow 1 Data range 10/10 to present   I have noticed an increase in dischargeflow starting in Early October. Is this somthing that should be trained into the model

On 4/27, as the gross load increased from 80 to 150 MW, the Y axial shaft position shifted from 9.5 to 4.5 mils, and the bearing 2 metal temptarure increased up to as high as 185 deg F. This is the largest change in Y axial position and highest bearing 2 metal temperature that has been seen in the last 120 days.

PD LUBE OIL FILTER appears to have a sensor problem 

Since 10/2, as the unit has switched to 1X1 operation, the FR1 Steam Turbine load decreased from 165~ MW to ~80 MW.  Y shaft vibration bearing 2 right has increased to 3.5 mils and bearing 2 left up to 2.8 mils from previous 2.6 and 2.5 mils.  Bearing 3 vibrations left increased from 2.9 to 3.2 mils.  Bearing 4 vibrations have increased from 0.5 to 0.75 mils.  Bearing 4 metal temperature decreased from 205 deg F at the higher loads down to 190 deg F at 80 MW, but as the operation at 80 MW continued, the bearing metal temperature increased to 202 deg F before the unit came offline.  Looking at the last time the steam turbine was at this load, during Nov. 2014, the bearing 4 vibrations were 0.65 versus up to 0.75 mils recently and the bearing 2 vibes were at the same level from last year.    

While looking at the steam turbine and generator vibrations over the last year, a  small step increase in Bearing 2 (2.5 to 2.6-2.65 mils) vibrations from 2.5 to 2.6-2.65 mils and gen bearing 1 (from 0.5 to 0.6 mils) vibrations from 0.5 to 0.6 mils was also noticed when GT-200 came off back in the middle of August.  

Update 10/20/15:  The ST vibrations appear to be settling out and have started to return in line with the model.  

Looks as if there has been a process change. The suction related pressure has dropped to 0 and the discharge pressures have gone up by a good amount. Is this an indication of a larger problem  This condition might be related to the attempted start up of the C-2901B compressor. the second screen shot will show this.

On 10/24 P STM BEF BLAD HP-TURB has started to decrease and reached values of 560 psig.

2/25: Case has been trained in the model

6/7: Y AXIAL SHAFT POS is currently trending at 2.60 mils.

7/28: Data trained in the model.

9/6/2016: Both Y AXIAL SHAFT POSITION (FR1_MAD20CY011) and (FR1_MAD20CY012) have been reporting values of 1.99 and 1.77 respectively, at a gross load of 175 MW.

As the unit has started to cycle more with ST load down to 80 MW starting on 10/2, the H201 COND PREHEATER (FR1_20TT-123) temperature has read values of 110 to 153 deg F, where H201 COND PREHEATER (FR1_20TT-123) has read values of 95 to 110 deg F.  The exhaust steam temp is 92-105 and this value makes sense and is line with the H201 COND PREHEATER (FR1_20TT-123).   The unit does not appear to have been operated at this load or with the increase in H201 COND PREHEATER (FR1_20TT-123) in the last year.

Update 08/31 from M&D: ADRE data would be useful if they had data from a previous run to compare to.  You can see from the plots below that there appears to have been a shift in amplitude during the coastdowns for BB2, but not so much on BB1.  It would be nice to have the proximity data to compare to but its not available on the OSM. There are two scenarios that Im thinking of here
1. Sensor issue:  could be issue with the mounting block stiffness/tightness or electrical interference on the cabling.
   a. Given the location of these two sensors the reading should be closer to each other the way it is now, not how it was back in May.  With the large variance between BB1/BB2 and the lack of proximity data it is difficult to come to any conclusions.  
2. Potential mass shift/loss:  
   a. The increase in amplitudes over time and the change in transient vibrations could suggest either a HGP component erosion or compressor blade migration.
   b. Without high confidence in the sensors I wouldnt jump to any conclusions so the most urgent disposition on this would be to borescope at the next outage once a sensor issue is eliminated. 

A balance shot could potentially lower the amplitudes but wouldnt solve the problem.  

During the period of operation 7/10-7/13, turbine blade path temperature spread (max - min) increased to as high as ~71F, normally only as high as ~56F.

Inlet Gas Temperature Sensor (1TE4305.XQ01) has been reading values lower when compared to the other HRSG inlet gas TCs. The sensor has also started to read intermittent spikes. On 6/7, the sensor was reading ~490F when the other TCs are reading  ~1050-1070F given gas turbine load. The sensor also spiked to <0F when the unit was in operation.


We have noticed a change in the temperature from ~70 to ~174 DegC. What are the correct units What is theappropriate temperature range for the bleed temp Is the trained data what we should expect or is it too low June 23: Temperature increased to ~200degC April 18:was there any work done on the bleed valve 2 also that you are aware of

HP drum level differential (max - min) increases to as high as ~5 inches and can be traced back to unstable behavior on drum level transmitter 1LT500C. Comparing to HRSG 3, HRSG 3 differential is <3 inches.

Previously reported 5/21 in Case 00220819. From Case 00220819, Exhaust Spread 1 increased as high as ~443degF during the start on 5/7. Exhaust Temp 9 was at ~255degF, the other TCs ranged between 510-773degF. Case closed has not recurred since July. 

Starting June 17. IP steam flow has begun to track ~5-8 KPPH below the model while previously tracking within ~1 KPPH. Comparing flows at ~74 MW before and after June 17, flow was ~45 KPPH (before) and ~39 KPPH (after).

IP attemperator spray flow is reading between ~4 100-5 000 lbm/hr with the unit offline. Update 8/11/2015: condition has cleared  GEIP to close case

The lube oil pressure after the filter has over the last three months been decreasing by ~10kPa. Are there limits for the pressure that we should be on the lookout for It seems bearing temperatures are running high at ~97degC.  April 11:We initially reported a possible lump oil pump issue on this asset on 2/2/2016 after a loss in lube oil pressure 16P7547 and an increase in bearing temperatures on case number 00356365. There was feedback from site to continue to monitor the issue until May. I inherently changed the notes and action code on Sentinel to link the advisories on the Gearbox, Generator and Gas Turbine to the possible lube pump issue reported. The significant increase in the vibration 16V7513 is seen after 3/7 after an increase the lube oil pressure. Pieter, can we also discuss this further with The Rapid response team and give feedback to Gustavo during the call on Thursday  April 12: We have also seen an shift in the GG Axial Displacemtent during this period afater the possible filter element change.

During the latest start on 8/3, increased differential was observed on several locations. The issues were noted on the following: Wheelspace  7/31     8/3       Issue appears to be on TC 1FI         ~60F    ~150F     GTT234B1 2AO        ~30F    ~60F      GTT236B2 3FO        ~13F    ~-37F     GTT239B1 9/22: Values have returned in line with the model.

Beginning June 17, HP FW flow (1FT5000B) has begun to drift upwards tracking ~20-25 KPPH above the model. Comparing flows at ~75 MW before and after June 17, flow was ~309 KPPH (before) and ~335 KPPH (after). Also, MS flow (1FT5050B) has begun to track low at decreased load. Comparing flows at ~75 MW before and after June 17, flow was ~240 KPPH (before) and ~215 KPPH (after)

On April 4, we saw temperature spikes on bearing temperatures up to ~80degC. There was also a corrsponding movement in the axial position 16Z7512 from ~0.1 to ~0.3mm during this time that has persisted since the start up after the spikes that we saw. The high GG Oil 2 Drain Bearing radial vibration Brg A has decreased after the 4/14 shutdown as discussed during the meeting on April 14. Can we train in the data after 14 April



On the 6/5, many shifts in the wheelspace differential temperatures have been noted.

24 August 2016: Condition Persists but is stable

31 August 2016: Condition Persists but is stable. Please let us know if this is acceptable for training in.

HP drum level differential (max - min) increases to as high as ~6.8 inches and can be traced back to unstable behavior on drum level transmitter 2LT500C. Transmitter 2LT500C also tracks at least 3.5 inches from the other two level transmitter. Comparing to HRSG 3, HRSG 3 differential is <3 inches.

During the last three startups, CTG_BRG_1_VIB_1_OVERALL_SEIS has been reading as high as ~0.35 in/s while CTG_BRG_1_VIB_2_OVERALL_SEIS increased to ~0.28 in/s during the last startup. We already have an escalated issue on CTG_BRG_2_VIB_1_OVERALL_SEIS which is reading ~ 0.3 in/s. The same issue was aslo seen on the Steady State asset GT 300

The tag (OPEN_AIR_INLET_TEMP_2) - 16T7540, T de aire frio a NDE gener (Generator NDE Inlet Cooling Air Temperature (Cold)), reached the SmartSignal Actual High Value of 50DegC on the 17th August 2016. The Generator DE Inlet Cooling Temperature also spiked but still remained below 50DegC.
This looks to have been as a result of a higher load. The load has since stepped back down and with this the Generator NDE Inlet Cooling Air Temperature has dropped below 50DegC.

If the SmartSignal limit for this tag (50DegC) is too conservative, please feel free to provide us with the Field limits and we will adjust the Actual Value High Limit accordingly.


Since coming back online 5/12  HP SP HTR OUT FLOW has been increased at ~999250 lbm/hr with SP HTR OUT PRESS ~1099 psig. Previously  this tag was only as high as ~813000-815000 lbm/hr. As a comparison  HRSG1 SP HTR OUT FLOW is as high as ~813000-815000 lbm/hr with SP HTR OUT PRESS ~1660-1675 psig.  Update 08/17/2015: HP steam flow and pressure have returned to the normal operating levels.

HRSG3 IP Drum pH periodically increases to ~10.5 before returning to expected values.

Beginning 9/3  LP drum level sensor 1 (IN_1) tag displayed erratic indication increasing to ~32 inches. This sensor has since returned to the model tracking ~0-0.25 inches. The other drum level sensors continue to tracking ~0-1.5 inches.  Update 2015-09-22: LP drum level sensor 1 (IN_1) tag is no longer displaying erratic behavior.   

On 8/8, LP FW flow showed a sharp increase, then began to track ~400 KPPH at baseload. Previous operation was ~500 KPPH at baseload. There is no corresponding change in LP drum level control valve position, LP drum pressure, or drum level.

there was seemingly an increase in the DE Seal Separation Gas Flow from ~5 to ~9kg/h. This issue seems to affects the bearings and the performance of the compressor. The booster driving air pressure seems to have also increased form the high of ~6barg to a new high of ~8barg. There is an ongoing case on this compressor with a possibility of the scrubber screen being dirty, a high level of the suction scrubber level or congested impellors on the 2nd stage that had increased the discharge pressure before but had since recovered until today. We are not sure of what the issue was and if any work was done on it case 18051. 

During all of the last 5 startups, the difference between Stage 1 wheelspace Temp Aft #1 and #2 has been increasing to as high as ~100 DegF. It looks like the AO 1 tag is causing this difference.

Within the past week, the BFPA recirc valve appears to be opening while the pump is online. No changes in HP/IP FW supply pressure are observed. IP FW flow is also trending normally along with BFPA discharge flow 1FT515B, but BFPA discharge flow 1FT515A is decreasing to 0 KPPH when the recirc valve opens up. 

Starting on 9/8, the GT-400 Stage 2 Wheelspace Temp AFT Out #1 showed downward spikes, however the #2 sensor remains consistent. Update 1/7/15: Persists Update 4/9/15: The sensor appears to have been repaired. Stage 2 Wheelspace Temp AFT Out #1 has gone from -2048F to ~750-800F with a differential ~58-60F

Drum level differential has increased to as high as ~3.3 inches after tracking <1 inch shortly after startup.

4/6: I have been reviewing the site and do not see any new notifications that need to be reviewed with the customer.

I would like to just revisit the case 17851 and close it. But before that I just need yours and Pieters expert input on this please.

Looking at the case I do not see that this is an issue and think we need to train this in.
The case is about the tag PIO550032 and it dropping below the actual low limit. 
If I look at the DCS screen for this unit I notice that there are 2 seal water pumps (A & B) and that this tag (PIO550032) measures the pressure of the flow from Pump A
Based on the screen shot I would assume that the pressure from Pump A & Pump B must be controlled so as not to over pressurise the Seal Water cooler.
Therefore tag PIO550032 will work in conjunction with tag PIO550022 (please see attached file).
The way I would like to configure SmartSignal is to put low and high limits on the flow tags FI 0550047 & FI 0550046.
What do you think the limits for this flow should be

On July 18 12:39 AM (site local time) unit 298308 dropped out of Premix Steady-State and into Extended Lean-Lean mode. The unit was running around 78 MW when a cold spot formed on exhaust TCs #3,4,7 which swirls back to Cans #1,2,4. I also see that the secondary flame detector in Can #4 (FD_INTENS_6) was decreasing indicating a weak or "dwindling flame". These cold spots led to high spreads which caused the controller to command a protective reignition of the primary combustion zone in order to prevent the unit from suffering a HETS or Loss of Flame Trip.


The compressor inlet pressure has been tracking lower than the model estimates since 6/22, with estimates reading between 4.25 inH2O and 6.25 inH2O, and recent operation operating between ~3.8 inH2O and 5 inH2O.

We have noted an unhealthy pattern in the Fuel Gas Control Valve Servo Current known as dither.

Karen M:
Dither is a square wave superimposed on the current signal for a control loop. The purpose of the dither is to reduce hysteresis of the valve. However, a high dither setting on control valves may contribute to wear on the valves. Recommendation is to remove the dither settings:
Dither_Freq=>Unused
DitherAmpl=>0
Refer to TIL 1813 for more information.

John P:
The case for not needing the dither can be justified because you can see that even at the different levels of the servo current, the controller is trying to make small adjustments to the position of the valve (which means you dont really need the dither signal)

Similar behavior has been seen on KT001 GT (298514). Removal of dither settings should also be addressed during next opportunity.

On May 5th we saw a large drop in the HOT_SIDE_OUTLET_FLOW_1 (52FI0207.PV) from the 52C001 to the 53V002 Feed Knockout Drum.  Flow was around 900 knm3/hr up until May 5, when it fell off sharply to around 775 knm3/hr.  In line with this change, we saw the HOT_SIDE_DIFF_PRESS which is the differential pressure across the 55E001 drier precooler (53PDI0331.PV) drop from around 0.350 bar to around 0.250 bar.

Since around July 16, we note a significant positive deviation from model estimate in both X&Y DE Bearing Vibrations, up to as high as 23um, with an estimate of ~15um. This seems to correspond with an increase in temperatures accross the motor, including Bearing Metal Temperatures, Motor Winding Temperatures, and Lube Oil Temperature. There is no change in speed during this time, but there has been a consistent drop in 56K004 Section 4 Compressor Gas Power since early May.

High Pressure Drive End Secondary Vent Gas Flows Model Tag 1 previously flatlined at 0 Seal (58FI8076.PV) is now returning values around~ 0.5 NM3/H.  HP Non-Drive End Secondary Vent Gas Flow Seal System Model Tag 2 (58FI8079.PV) remains mostly flatlined but had a high flow on March 21 reaching up to ~0.70 NM3/H.  High alarms for the both flows are at 12.  Separation Gas Seal Header Pressure (58PI8082.PV) is showing elevated trends up to ~1.00 barg as compared to previous 0.90 barg operation which is also reflected on both DE/NDE N2 Separation Gas pressures and flows.  Elevated Nitrogen is not good for labyrinth seals and only ~0.5 barg is required instead of the current elevated levels.

April 15: Noted spike in N/DE Seal Outlet Pressure for about an hour.  Flare event

April 18: Since the 11th the DE flows have fallen to 0 and the NDE are in the 1.00 nm3H range.

June 27: Some more spiking on DE and NDE Primary Seal Outlet Pressures and Secondary Vent Flows are at 0 on DE and about 1.3 nm3/h on the NDE side.

July 27 HP NDE 2RY Vent Gas Flow (58FI8079.PV) step changed down from about 1.5 nm3/h to a range of 0 - 0.35 nm3/h.

On 1/6, the Gas Scrubber Pressure increased to 639 from 348 psi.

VESSEL_TAG_4/5 (348PI3003.PV)/(348PC0802.PV) stepped up from ~ 2.5 barg on June 3rd up to ~ 2.86 barg and remained flatlined there until June 6 and again from June 11 to June 17.  There are several other tags in the model that appear flatlined, but this one had previously shown regular movement.  This could be a potential data compression situation or failing instrumentation.  This correlates with a slight increase of HOT_SIDE_STREAM_1_INLET_TEMP_1 (348TI3001.PV) which has a high alarm at -145 deg C.

High alarm is at 3.0 barg.

Both the DE and NDE bearing vibrations have decreased over the past month. DE vibrations have decreased from 2 to 1 mil.  NDE vibrations have decreased from 2.3 to 1.3 mils.

On May 3rd 2016, the HOT_SIDE_STREAM_1_OUTLET_TEMP_1 (40TI0007A.PV) fell below a low alarm of 155 deg C and continued to fall to a low of 146 deg C.  Historically, this temperature stays right at this level right above the alarm.  As a result of the temperature decrease, the HOT_SIDE_STREAM_1_INLET_CTRL_VLV_POS (40TC0007.OUT) should compensate for the drop in temperature and open the valve controlling the steam flow to the 40E008A stripper reboiler, thereby getting the temperature back to the set point.  This particular reboiler provides heat to the 40-C001 condensate stripper column.  During this time the COLD_SIDE_STREAM_1_INLET_TEMP_1 from the stipper column back to the reboiler shows a corresponding drop.  This entire event lasted roughly 20 hours and the temperatures have returned to pre event levels.  Finally, the HOT_SIDE_STREAM_1_INLET_CTRL_VLV_POS or the controller behind it may have some delay manifested as a potential sticking valve, or controller error.

On Sunday the 10th of July, while on process gas, Bravo GT (AI477_GT) tripped on what is reported to be low lube oil supply pressure. The unit was successfully restarted on diesel:

From customer: "Trip occured at 16.00 on GT lube oil low pressure PT47705. Transmitter removed from Alpha turbine to service Bravo turbine. Start put in at 20.11 on diesel and was sucessful. Left running on diesel overnight. Transmitter is a Rosemount model 3051 so a replacement is needed."

On Monday the  11th, an attempt to change over from diesel to process gas was made and the unit tripped  on secondary purge valve position fault. Restart was abandoned until Tuesday the 12th.

Smart Signal trends show a steady lube oil supply pressure (PT47705) until a sudden drop on the 10th. The lube oil low pressure alarm in Smart Signal is set to be 3 barg. This pressure was reading ~4.40 barg prior to the trip, meaning this limit was not reached prior to the trip.

The IPRC also notes that the Liquid Fuel Inner Manifold Pressure came back higher on the start up. It is trending at ~33 barg with an estimate of ~16 barg. We currently do not have a actual value limits for this tag and would request guidance on these limits. 
We further note that the Gas Fuel Demand Valve has gone flatlined. From previous correspondence we assume that this is due to a lack of demand on this valve since the unit is on diesel.

Can the customer confirm the cause of the drop in lube oil supply pressure.

7/22/2016: There were three more trips reported. These occured on the 16th, 18th and 20th. On all three occasions, there was no gradual change in the monitored parameters. The trips were sudden and could only be seen in Smart Signal once they had occured.

From the customer:

    7/16/2016: "Trip occurred at 17.39 on PT47705 low lube oil supply pressure on GT. This is the same trip occurrence as the trip on July 10th. We know it is not the transmitter as it has already been changed. Loop and insulation check of system did not show up any anomaly. Shunt barrier safety diode changed as precaution. No fault could be found on bench test of old barrier. Then it was noticed on the alarm page that several alarms came on together at the time of the trip with PT47705 been the one highlighted. The same alarms are common to Linknet module card N202. A replacement card was sourced in stores and fitted. Immediately after the trip, several attempts were made to crank the engine to avoid the 4 hour lock out but each attempt was prevented by generator jacking oil failure. It was decided to leave the unit off overnight. "

    7/18/2016:"Running fine until trip occurred at 20.33 during attempted hp fuel filter changeover. Unit went in to 4 hour lock once again. Generator jacking oil pump failure prevented us from avoiding a four hour lockout."

    7/20/2016:"Alpha is still in a shutdown state. During testing of the fuel gas system today, the off skid gas valve was cycled open from the Woodward CC which caused the Bravo unit to trip. Note that Bravo was running on liquid fuel. Several alarms occurred, all derived from one Linknet module. There appears to be some correlation between the two units, the only shared signals are derived from the WHRU. Investigation is ongoing..."

The IPRC will keep monitoting this case for updates.

7/29/2016: Root cause for trips not yet received, but Bravo GT looks stable from SS. IPRC will keep this case open for feedback but will no longer send out updates on it until feedback is received.

2014-Aug-19:
From 2014-Apr-19 to 2014-May-13, the 6608B motor current was spiking up and down between ~145 amps and ~175 amps. From 2014-May-28 to 2014-Jun-06, the 6608A motor current was spiking between ~145 amps and ~170 amps. From 2014-Jun-08 to 2014-Jun-10 and from 2014-Jun-15 to 2014-Jun-18, the 6608A motor current spiked down to ~145 amps from ~155 amps. Finally, from 2014-Aug-07 to 2014-Aug-12, the 6608A motor current was spiking between ~135 amps and ~165 amps. 

These motor current changes appear to coincide with suction temperature and flow changes on both pumps. As suction temperature was trending up from 2014-Apr-19 to 2014-May-13, the 6608A motor current was more cyclic until the pump was shut down. The 6608B motor current was stable until a slight temperature increase on 2014-May-28. The current fluctuated until the temp dropped on 2014-Jun-06 for approx. 1 day.  After the quick shutdown/startup of A/B pumps, there were some slight motor current deviations for the A pump until the suction temp dropped by ~12 degC on 2014-Jun-18. The motor current remained stable until the suction temperature increase on 2014-Aug-07. The A pump was taken offline and the B pump was placed online on 2014-Aug-12. Since then, the B motor current has been stable at the same suction temperature.

2014-Aug-26: The B motor current was spiking again from 2014-Aug-21 until shutdown on 2014-Aug-25. The A motor current has been spiking slightly after startup, beginning on 2014-Aug-26.

2014-Sep-30: The A motor current had spiked down once and up once since the startup on 2014-Sep-29.
2014-Oct-07: The A motor current had a few small spikes a day after the startup on 2014-Oct-02; it is more stable in the recent past few days.
2014-Oct-14: The A current has been stable at ~163 amps since 2014-Oct-04.
2014-Oct-21: The A current remains stable.
2014-Oct-28: The A current stepped down from ~163 amps to ~156 amps on 2014-Oct-22, and has remained fairly stable at that value.
2014-Nov-04: The A current has increased back up to ~164 amps; current still remains stable.

The motor bearing temperature did not get too high, but something is not correct for such a change. The pump bearing temperature did not experience such a drastic temperature change. The motor current was fairly stable during this time as well.
2014-Oct-21: The motor bearing temperatures have not spiked upward in the past week; the NDE/DE bearing temperature has gotten as high as ~64 degC / ~44 degC.
2014-Oct-28: The motor DE bearing temperature had taken step changes up to ~40 degC and back down to ~25 degC from 2014-Oct-23 to 2014-Oct-25 and on 2014-Oct-27. The motor NDE bearing temperature had taken a step changes up to ~60 degC and back down to ~40 degC on 2014-Oct-25 and 2014-Oct-27.

During startup on 7/22/2016  PRI APH B Main Drive Current increased to ~9.6 Amps  2.5 Amps higher than estimated and previous running condition.  At the same time  PRI APH B Support Bearing Temp increased as high as 180 DegF  ~50 DegF higher than model estimate and previous operation. Weekly Report 8/22/16: Determined if this was just a startup issue or is there an ongoing issue. Weekly Report 9/2/16: Determined what the cause was for this issue

On 2014-Apr-5, one sensor for the inboard bearing temperature had taken a step change up from ~40 degC to ~70 degC. The other sensor remained fairly stable. The outboard bearing temperatures also remained fairly stable. 

Also, the sensors for the inboard temperature are not very close and neither are the sensors for the outboard temperature. One of the inboard temperatures is very similar to one of the outboard temperatures.

2014-Apr-22 : Condition appears cleared.

2009-Aug-19: appears that WBE accidentally trained PERF model rather than MECH -- regardless  adaptation on PERF model acceptable (high ambient temps had started to generate incidents last night).  Please wait on this MECH adaptation regardless -- it appears that the SUP and GDE Brg temps have switched hi/lo  item now posted to CMM. /*************************************************/ 8-19-09: Added adaptation data to MECHANICAL model.  Begin: 8/10 12:00 (startup) End: present Limits: none Faulted: N  Hotter ambient temps have pushed the GDE Brg temps up to 140-155 deg F. Please stripe this in.

When the pump started up on July 8th, the DE Seal Supply Temperature (066TI1161) increased from 208 to 257 deg C and the DE Bearing Metal Temperature (066TI1133) increased from 72 to 84 deg C.

In the MECH model  the brg temp measurements were swapped between Secondary AH A and Primary AH B during implementation. Since then  the correct brg temps have been added to each MECH model (as SUPPORT or GUIDE bearing temp 2). Please inactivate the incorrect brg temps at the asset level and train in fresh data for the brg temps -- all readings currently being observed are normal.  So to recap:  01. Flip the incorrect brg temps off at the asset level on both Primary AH B and Secondary AH A (youaphosll notice the OPC sensor names give it away). 02. Turn on the XX_BEARING_TEMP_2 sensors  which are appropriate for each asset  at the model level. 03. Stripe in fresh data -- this will likely end up being a complete retrain for each MECH model. 04. Complete on both assets.

The seal temperatures on G6610B are ~60 degC hotter than the seal temperatures on G6610A.

Model: PERF (HEATER TEMPS) Tag Name: AH_GAS_OUTLET_TEMP_1 Acceptable Date Range: 10/3 to present Description: please stripe in this date range of data (avoiding the valve test on the morning of 10/5) -- these levels are typical for colder ambient temps. Furthermore  the gas disch temp on SAH A has historically been 30-40 deg F cooler than SAH B  and this relationship still holds.

On June 27th, the Pump DE Bearing Metal Temperature (066TI1135) spiked up to a value as high as 133.4 degC. There was no change in motor current at this time. There was also a drop in the DE Seal Drain Temperature (066TI1165) from ~196 degC to ~157 degC on June 26th.

Aug 15: From August 6th to August 8th, 066TI1135 started exhibiting erratic readings, peaking at 168.90 degC. It spiked up again on August 9th to 168.75 degC.

Model: PERF (HTR PRESS) Tag Name: AH_AIR_OUTLET_PRESS_1 and AH_GAS_DELTA_PRESS_MEAS Acceptable Date Range: 11/16 0000 (after derate) to present (11/17 1115 at time of writing) Description: please stripe in the increased fd fan discharge pressure (mistakenly labeled as AH AIR OUTLET PRESS) -- levels to 17.75 INWC are acceptable and should be brought in. Furthermore  the increased gas side d/p corresponds to this overall flow increase -- please stripe in levels up to 9.5 INWC.

The DE Seal Inj Flow (066EI6610A2) was spiking up to as high as 1.68 A with an estimate of 0.80 A on August 20th. It dropped to 0 A on August 24th but recovered after 15 minutes. During this time, the DE Seal Drain Temperature (066TI1165) also dropped from ~186 degC to ~166 degC and the DE Seal Supply Temperature (066TI1164) increased from ~188 degC to ~200 degC.

Model: MECH (ALL) Tag Name: GUIDE_BEARING_TEMP_2 Acceptable Date Range: 12/1 to present Description: readings on this tag have been consistently low-biased -- decrease in brg temp can be attributed to colder ambient conditions.Temps between 100-120 deg F are OK.

The inboard/outboard seal drain temperatures and inboard/outboard seal supply temperatures have been spiking~30 degC. The outbard seal temperaturesare spiking from ~170 degC to ~200 degC. The inboard seal temperatures are spiking from ~230 degC to ~200 degC. It appears that the spiking behavior alternates from inboard to outboard.

2014-Apr-28 : Condition continues.
2014-May-06 : Condition continues.
2014-May-13 : Condition continues.
2014-May-20 : Control scheme appears different for the barrier fluid temp control in the 6613A and 6613B pumps: the 6613A barrier fluid temp control on NDE appears to be at a lower temp the 6613B NDE. In addition, the 6613B NDE barrier fluid temp is much less than the DE barrier fluid temp (~170 degC vs. ~230 degC).

One reading for the inboard bearing temperature and one reading outboard bearing temperature were steadily increasing from Apr 4 to Apr 9 from ~40 degC to ~50 degC. The readings then took a step change down from ~50 degC to ~20 degC. The other inboard bearing temperatureand the other outboard bearing temperature were stable during this time at ~45 degC and ~25 degC, respectively.

2014-Apr-22 : Condition cleared.

Model: PERF Tag Name: AH_GAS_DELTA_PRESS_MEAS Acceptable Date Range: 1/7 to present Description: please stripe in D/P readings up to 10 INWC -- the latest increase that is now causing incidents can be attributed to a higher airflow profile through this HTR.

Can you confirm the units and location of these tags Based off their description, 066PI1004appears to be a filter dP and 066PI1008 appears to be a sump level.

On August 1st, the Motor NDE bearing metal temperature (066TI1505) increased to 69.0 degC while the pump was in operation. However, there was not a similar increase in the Motor DE  bearing metal temperature (066TI1503) which was reading 40.8 degC during this time. Currently, 066TI1505 & 066TI1503 have values of 60.8 degC and 40.7 degC, respectively.

Also, the suction vessel level (066LC1006) is behaving erraticly and the suction pressure (066PI1055) had been slowly trending downward since the beginning of the last run which started on July 20th. 066PI1055 has a current value of -0.36 bar.



After the unit downpower on 2/23  the gas side DP on this preheater has been reading consistently between 11-11.5 INWC. Before the downpower  the DP was steady at appx 10 INWC. No other changes occurred at this time.

After the startup on August 21st, the Inboard Seal Drain Temperature (066TI1157) started spiking to as high as ~450 degC. This also occurred in October of last year. The Inboard Seal Supply Temperature (066TI1156) did not exhibit any spiking.

On 4/25 the pressure on both of the secondary air heaters have increased. Air heater A increased from 11.4 to 12.7 in H2O and air heater B increased from 11.5 to 12.3 in H2O. We have seen a decrease in air heater gas inlet temperature with an increased outlet temperature.

The Motor Stator Temperature Phase C is consistently 5 degC higher than both Phase A and B when the motor is running. However, all phases read right about the same temperature when the unit is offline. 

07/18/2016 - On July 11th, the Motor Stator Temperatures Phase A, B, and C peaked at values of 90.33 degC, 90.72 degC, and 95.41 degC, respectively.

Since the unit startup on June 16th, the STAGE_2_CYLINDER_A_SEISMIC_VIBRATION (066VI1902) has been as high as 6.29 mm/s and the VENT_GAS_TEMP_1 (066TI1907) has been as high as 48.2 degC. These deviations from the model estimate seem to go together with changes in the Stage 2 cylinder rod drop (066GI1902) which might indicate that the packing and cylinder lubrication could be taking a while to start providing the needed lubrication. There was nothing on the discharge temperature that might have been the cause for the higher vent temperature. When the vent temperature goes up and the discharge temperature does not go up, this could be a sign of inadequate packing lubrication and could lead to accelerated rider band wear on the piston. The Stage 1 cylinder rod drop (066GI1901) has peaked at 0.26mm.

07/18/2016 - The Stage 2 cylinder rod drop (066GI1902) has peaked at -0.09mm.

Please manually adapt as faulted data as the aph continues to foul.

On July 26th, the Stage 2 Discharge Pressure (066PI1930) dropped to 6.26 bar from 10.26 bar and remained there for about two and a half hours. No changes were seen in any of the other variables during this time. 066PI1930 then returned to 10.28 bar. It appears to have done this on July 12th as well, for about 20 minutes, and on December 1st of 2015 for about 5 hours.

This is approximately 28-30 deg C higher than ALL other mill motor stator temps  which all peaked between 80-82 deg C at this time. It seems that historically this particular stator temp has been significantly higher than the others (levels to about 108 deg C appear to be trained in).

Request for adaptation VERY similar to what has been posted for other mills. See ID#38 (which is also linked below).

2009-Aug-27: pulverizer behavior discussed with Tim Golightly  lower pri air temps and coal air out points acceptable based on mill vibes and noise levels. Please adapt. /*************************************************/ After a brief outage the coal air out temp has dropped from 130 to 125 deg F. The feeder speed and air flow readings are trending at typical levels. Is this potentially a set pt or coal type change

The motor current tag has been generating incidents for high current occasionally over the past 24 hrs -- the increased current levels correspond to an increase in coal flow to this mill. Please adapt on the current op cond to prevent further spurious incidents.  Model: PERF Begin: 9/3 00:00 End: present Limits: none Faulted: N


Model: PERF (ALL) Tag Name: MILL_CURRENT Acceptable Date Range: 10/5 12:00 to present Description: mill motor current is following the primary air and coal flow tags. The current reading of approx 45 A is acceptable -- the recent shifts can probably be attributed to varying coal conditions... Boardman is having a dust suppression issue in the coal yard and the water levels have been changed.

Model: PERFORMANCE Tag Name: MILL_MTR_OB_BRG_MTL_TEMP Acceptable Date Range: 7/14 - Present Description: Please train-in temp up to 135 degF

2009-Aug-27: please adapt on recently observed mill op conditions  levels are acceptable as per Tim Golightly. PLEASE  however  avoid the ramps on AIR_DELTA_PRESS_MEAS that were seen on 8/21-22  8/23  and 8/24. These were a result of a broken impulse line that was clogging rapidly. /*************************************************/ 2009-Aug-17: over the weekend (on 8/13) the coal air out temp dropped from 150 to 130 deg F -- is this coal air out temp shift the result of a set pt change /*************************************************/ Mill motor current has increased from 40 to 45 amps (appx 8/14 00:00 CDT). However  the coal flow and airflow profiles have not shifted  though a decrease in coal air temp has been observed (from 150 to 130 deg F). Is this indicative of a change in coal type


The present RTs on MILL_CURRENT are +/- 2 amps. It appears that these incidents on the WL are caused by higher ambient temps resulting in higher motor stator readings  which the model interprets as being indicative of more motor current (ambient temp is not presently a part of this model).

The motor stator temps have been steadily trending above the modeleled prediction since 1/15.The stator temp is now at a 5-7 deg C positive residual consistently with a local max of 70 deg C.

We are seeing Overall Bearing Vibrations (11MBD11CY001_XQ60) on the #1 bearing increase in magnitude and in frequency of the peaks. Historically, this bearing has operated with peaks around 35 um. Since we activated this asset on 5/9/2011, these peaks have increased in magnitude with peaks as high as 200 um. The frequency of these peaks has also increased over the past few days. I have attached some charts for the vibration parameters on this bearing as a reference. These increased vibrations appear to be more prevalent in the X direction and not in the Y direction. Can you please help us determine whether this is a real issue, an issue with the vibration instrument, or if this is simply behavior that is typical of this unit and should be included in the model

HP_MAIN_STEAM_PRESS_1 signal is erratic and reading lower than expected when compared to HP_DRUM_PRESS_1. 

TC 21 is tracking lower than the remaining TCs, causing ~80F spread. Recently closed case 19351.

In comparing the prior year this Spread 1 and Spread 2 have increased signicantly specifcally when chiller turned on in June.  This could be a tuning issue or a TC issue.  This is not changing and staying steady and appears could be DLN Tuning related.  Without CO and NOx (Raw) it is hard to determine if there is a tuning or hardware issue.  Recommend changing TC 21 at first offline opportunity.  If probleme persits the condition is hardware or tuning.

Starting August, 20th Ammonia Flow (CRBFT202) trends consistently higher than its baseline operational actuals (0.18 GPM) for the past 60 days.

On Apr 15, DE Seal Outlet Pressure spiked up to 46 mBarg at 1:40am, and then dropped down to -3.7 mBarg and stayed at that level until 1:30pm, when it stepped back up to the model estimate.
Apr 28: Seal pressures have started showing erratic patterns. Is this behavior acceptable

On Apr 19, both Stage 1 Suction Temp and Discharge Flow stepped up to ~33C (estimate of ~26C) and ~24 m3/hr (estimate of ~18 m3/hr). Deviations were noted on other performance parameters, but not this kind of a step change.

Also, we do not note any increase in discharge temperature for K01 Compressor.

Are there any tags available to monitor the temperatures/performance of the cooler between K01 and K58

Annulus B Pressure has been increasing above the previously-stated alert limit of 25 Barg, about once a week. In addition, the A/B differential pressure has been approaching 0 Barg.

Is this previous request from late 2014 still valid
1) Create a new CV to calculate the delta pressure between Annulus A and B pressures, and set the residual thresholds such that advisories fire when the delta pressure reaches around 0. 
2) Create a new CV to calculate the rate of change of the annulus bleed down pressure, and set the residual thresholds such that advisories fire when the rate of change reaches 50 psi/min. 
3) Remove negative residual thresholds for Annulus A and B pressures, adjust positive residual threshold for Annual A and B pressures such that advisories fire when the pressure reaches 25 barg.

4/11: Temp has returned to estimate

8/22: After analyzing the behavior further, we think there may be some wiring issue that causes erratic readings during operation. This is because of the stability of the readings when the unit is offline, and also because the Cylinder, Plug, and Ignition Coil have all been verified as good. The neighboring cylinders seem to be unaffected, which indicates it may be instrumentation-related.

After 4/30 shutdown and startup,all Compressor Cylinders began reading ~5F hotter than before. Also, Cylinder B Discharge Temp is ~7F hotter than Cylinders A, C, and D. Suction Temperature and Engine Speeddid not change at the same time.

On 11/25, Current dropped between ~105 Amps and 0 Amps. On 12/3, the datafeed cut out.

Has this pump been removed from service

Motor temp has been spiking up between ~60 degC and ~140 degC since 8 Nov 2014. At the same time, downhole pressure has been elevated at ~7307 kPa with model prediction at ~4800 kPa.
11/27 - Motor current and motor temperature remain erratic.  Downhole pressure continues to cycle, reaching highs of ~7000 kPa.

Since start of monitoring in August, we note a steady decrease over time of the Current, with intermittent shutdowns.

About once a week, we note that the Current will drop to ~70 Amps and Motor Temp will increase to ~100C. We also note a corresponding drop in Downhole Pressure and Vibration.

Since 11/12, we note that the Output Current will begin fluctuating by ~50 Amps during the periods of around 7am to 12pm (noon). On the 13th of November, this fluctuation severely increased and led to several shutdowns of the pump. We note a similar shutdown pattern with high Motor Temperature starting on 12/1.
12/11: Motor Temp has spiked as high as 110F, with an estimate of ~50F.

Since 9/16, Motor Temperature has increased from ~55C to ~60C., with an estimate of ~54C. Over this same period, Downhole Temperature has increased from 50C to 54C, and Downhole Pressure has dropped to as low as ~2900 kPa, with an estimate of ~3500 kPa.
11/27 - Issue persists.

11/6: Motor Current has begun to fluctuate erratically between 200 Amps and 185 Amps.
11/13: Condition continues.

Since datafeed came back on 11/5, Motor Current has been fluctuating between ~120 Amps and ~250 Amps. Also, Motor Temp has been consistently reading ~68C, with an estimate of ~60C.

11/13/2014: Condition has cleared.

DMRoe 9/26/14:
"Based on what I am seeking, the behavior does not look healthy starting on 09/23 at 11 AM.   One scenario could be a slug of sand entering the annulus and causing the annulus pressure to drop, this is assuming the down hole pressure transmitter is in the annulus between the pump and containment wall near the pump suction.  This could aslo account for the initial drop in amp and down hole pressure.  When the amp draw came back up, one possibility could be the slug of heavier material with sand going thru the pump until such time that it cleared.  

When I see the amps drop it normally would indicated a loss of pump suction.  I also do not think the vibration behavior looks healthy after the first amp drop and subsequent increase in pressure.  This could be random pumping due to the pump cavitating.

Do we have any drawings for these assets.  I would like to know where the down hole pressure and temperature are being measured to confirm what I am seeing.  

I am also wandering if they have a desander downstream of these pumps and if so, did it show any unusual behavior."

During the startup on 11/3, Motor Temperature, Downhole Vibrations, and Downhole Temperature all began spiking erratically. Also during this time, we note an increased Downhole Pressure as high as 5825 kPa, with an estimate of ~3000 kPa.
11/27 - Issue persists.

This issue was originally sent as an Email Notification on 11/4.

11/13/2014: Condition has stabilized.

On 10/28, the Output Current dropped down to 0 Amps, following a decrease of ~30 Amps (155A to 125A).  At this same time, there was a noted increase in Motor Temperature to as high as 96C (estimate of ~55C).

This seems to be a new pump for the well, as the datafeed had returned on 10/16.
11/13/2014: Condition has cleared.

Since ~11/17, on a regular basis to ~65 Amps, recovers, and later drops to 0 Amps.

Since ~10/1, Output Current has been dropping to as low as 180 Amps, with a model estimate of ~208 Amps. We also note a slow decrease in Downhole Pressure and Temperature, as well as elevated Downhole Vibration and Motor Temperature.
11/7: Since 11/4 current has been dropping out and Motor Temp has been spiking up
11/13: Output current has returned to model predictions.
11/27 - Output currentdecreased to ~180 amps.

Since 11/10, Motor Output Current has been spiking downward to ~0 Amps very erratically. We note a similar trend in Motor Temperature and Downhole Vibration, as well as an increase of Downhole Pressure to as high as 9000 kPa.
11/27 - Issue persists.


Motor Current is spiking between 0 and 180 Amps, Motor Temperature has increased to over 90C, and Downhole Pressure, Temperature, and Vibrations are also spiking with load. We suspect a possible loss of suction flow to the pump.

There is a steady drop in Motor Current since 10/15, followed by an increase in Motor Temperature and erratic signatures on Downhole Temperature, Pressure, and Vibration. It looks like pump is still pumping but the output is lower. Pump motor temp is very close to downhole temperature, so  it is not a complete loss of flow, but a significantly reduced flow.

11/13/2014: Condition has stabilized.
11/27/2014 - Erratic motor current and motor temperature signatures have returned as of 11/23.

From 11/11 to 11/17, we note several drops in Current to ~150 Amps. Since several critical tags (Motor Temp and DH Tags) are flatlined at zero, we are unable to see correllations with motor current.
11/27 - Motor current has stabalized between ~190 amps and ~230 amps.  Downhole pressure remains flatlined.

2014-Apr-28: Since 2014-Apr-11, the skin temperatures for tube 10 pass 1 and 2 at 9.5 m elevation have been increasing. The drop in load on 2014-Apr-9 did not result in an increase in pass 1 or pass 2 temperatures. At the same loading on 2014-Apr-18, the pass 1 and 2 tube 10 temp is 25 deg C higher (~510 degC vs. ~485 degC). All of the other skin temperatures are stable with the exception on skin temperature 6 (066TI1424) which is reading abnormally low (Report 8).
2014-May-06 : Condition continues. Pass 1 and 2 Rohr 10 9,50m temperatures are at ~520 degC.
2014-Jul-08: Pass 1 Tube 10 at 9.50m (Skin Temp 4) has gotten as high as ~554 degC.
2014-Jul-15: Skin Temp 4,8 has decreased from~550 degC to ~490 degC, trending with the decrease in fuel gas flow.
2014-Aug-12: Condition continues; difference between the pass inlet pressures continue to increase.
2014-Aug-19: After the quick shutdown/startup on 2014-Aug-17, the burner configuration was different from before with burner 1 (lowest elevation) on and burner 4 (highest elevation) off; burner 2 and 3 did not change and are on. After the startup, the pass inlet flow is higher for both passes, with pass 1 receiving slightly more flow, and the total fuel flow to the burners was higher as well. Due to the change in burner configuration, the skin temperatures at the middle elevation are highest, skin temperatures at the medium to lower elevations had the greatest temperature increase, and the skin temperatures at the highest elevation had a temperature decrease. The difference between the two passesaphos inlet pressures remain elevated at ~4.5 bar.
2014-Aug-26: The difference between the two passesaphos inlet pressure has increased up to ~8.5 bar. The bottom three burners are on and the highest burner is off. The skin temperatures are still elevated and have slightly decreased with a decreasing fuel flow.
2014-Sep-02: The burner configuration has not changed (bottom three burners are on). The recent decrease then increase in all of the skin temperatures correspond to the decrease then increase in burner fuel flow. The decrease then increase in the difference between the pass 1, 2 inlet pressures occurs at the same time as these changes in the burner fuel flow. The current difference between the pass 1, 2 inlet pressures is ~8.0 bar. When the fuel flow increased slightly on 2014-Sep-02, the difference between the pass 1, 2 inlet flows increased (pass 1 inlet flow is ~35.5 m3/h and pass 2 inlet flow is ~32.4 m3/h).
2014-Sep-09: Condition continues; values are similar to before.
2014-Sep-16: Unit is offline. The difference between the pass 1 and 2 inlet pressure had gotten as high as ~9.5 bar.
2014-Sep-30: Unit is starting up. All burners are on. There is flow going through passes. Temperatures are increasing. Pass inlet pressures began indicating non-zero pressure on 2014-Oct-01 at ~3AM Austria time.
2014-Oct-07: The pass 1 and 2 inlet pressures are no longer very different and are at ~24.5 psig and ~24.0 psig. The pass 1 and 2 outlet temps are similar (at ~460 and ~462 degC). The skin temperatures currently are between ~400 degC and ~500 degC.

2014-Oct-28: Condition remains stable.
2014-Oct-30: On 2014-Oct-29 at ~12PM (local Central European time), various heater parameters had taken step changes up or down and/or became erratic afterward (in the charts attached, the parameters that changed are highlighted in red boxes). For example, the pass 1 inlet pressure has been oscillating between ~24 bar and ~25 bar, and the pass 2 inlet pressure has been oscillating between ~23 bar and ~24 bar. In addition, feed quality parameters, such as the pass density, viscosity, compositions, and conversions have changed as well.
2014-Nov-04: The change in feed quality along with pass inlet/outlet pressure, fuel gas flow, etc. continue.
2014-Nov-10: Condition continues.

The difference in temperature between skin 3 and 4 (i.e. the skin 3 4 spread) has been erratic: being as high as ~80 degC and as low as ~0 degC. This behavior is a result of the skin 4 temperature reading being as high as ~525 degC and as low as ~440 degC. The skin 2, 3, and 5 temperatures have been fairly stable during this time.

2014-Apr-22 : Temperature has been stable at ~510 degC for the past few days.

The AFT bearing on case 1 has in the past week reached and exceeded the alarm of 85um. The longest run was on 4/11 to 5/11 and then recovered. Another spike was seen on 6/11.

November 9: We have lost datafeed on all PDO assets. The ASCII file team has been notified. 

11/23: We have seen a significant improvement in the case 1 vibrations. Was there any work done Can we close the case as actioned 


We have been monitoring a loss in flow to ~290000SM3/D with negative residuals from the model estimate of ~326000SM3/D. The efficiency on stages 2 and 3 has also decreased correlating with this flow loss. 


The tag (MOTOR_DE_BRG_VIB_1_OVERALL) - BC24-VT-671647-X, WCK CPP (BC24) Train 1 E-Mtr Rad X-Vib Lp End, has flatlined while in operation. 

PRELIMINARY NOTIFICATION: We have seen a high Phase B4 stator temperature up to ~150degC. There was an initial increase when the motoraphoss load was increased on January 20 but the Phase B4 temperature did not recover like the other stator temperatures when the load was decreased.  

April 18: Dear BG Group,
We have seen a possible sensor issue on the X vibration that has flat lined at zero and did not come back up after the recent start up. 

4/29: The issue persists

We have been monitoring an increase in motor stator temperatures on all phases to a maximum of ~115degC after the increase in thhe motor current on Jan 7. Can we train this new data in

The DE and NDE gearbox pinion bearing temperatures are spiking to ~105degC. 

We have on two occasions seen the thrust bearing axial positions spiking and then recovering while the unit is in operation. This correlates with a decrease in load as well the suction strainer DP. 

There was an increase in the strainer DP from ~6kPa to 8kPa (Smart Signal HI=6kPa). Is the set limit correct

There seems to have been a valve position opening during operation. This has affected the load and we are looking at an axial displacement of ~0.28mm and the alarm was given at 0.32mm trip during a call conversation. The inlet strainer and other seal system tags are also affected. Motor vibrations also increased during this time when the inlet strainer DP increased to ~7.6kPa.

Jan 8: We have been monitoring an increase in bearing temperatures from 85degC to ~94degC. The increase correlates with an increase in speed on the gearbox from ~1700rpm to ~1800rpm and the axial position. The lube oil temperature and pressure seem to be stable. What limit can we set on SmartSignal for the bearing temperatures 
Jan 15: The issue recovered after the speed decreased from ~1800rpm to ~1650rpm. 

Jan 8: The tag (GB_DRIVEN_DE_BRG_MTL_TEMP_2) - BC24-TE-672611, WCK CPP (BC24) Train 2 Grbx Pinion Rad Brng Temp De has flatlined at zero. 

The seal gas filter DP has been gradually increasing over the last month (SmarrtSignal HI=50kPa). The seal gas supply pressure has increased from ~4900kPa to ~5200kPa (SmartSignal 7500kPa). Are these limits correct and can we train this data in

We have been monitoring at erratic behaviour in the (GB_SEIS_VIB_2) - BC24-AE-673644-2, WCK CPP (BC24) Train 3 LP Gearbox Accelerometer-2, initially on 3/10. It does seem to read approximately the same in magnitude as the correlating tag (GB_SEIS_VIB_1) - BC24-AE-673644-1, WCK CPP (BC24) Train 3 LP Gearbox Accelerometer-1. After the recent start up, it has been consistent and has not stopped. 

4/13: The current gearbox driven speed is ~9408rpm and the issue seems to have recovered and trending with the model estimate. The speed at which the high vibration seems to occur is at ~9344rpm.
